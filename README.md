## I'm a software developer

I've been lucky to work on lots of varying projects with languages and frameworks. I believe in continually staying relevant and up to date with modern best practices and emerging technologies. I work mainly with web technologies from the frontend, all the way down to the database layer. I've used all the major SQL DBs and I'm `Mongo` certified. I really enjoy `Swift` (Vapor) and `Go` and they are my favourite languages, though I think `Rust` is a truly incredible language. At the frontend space, `Vue` and `TypeScript` mainly. I also do a fair amount of devops and interlinking of systems, where `Go` is my "Go-to" :grin:

Areas I'd like to help in some way are environmental protections for wildlife and their habitats, climate change and understanding the universe better
